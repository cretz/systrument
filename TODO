TODO:

* Make sure to clean up temp directory
* Support remote template execution
* Maybe a better piped communication protocol (SFTP is slow)
* Support multiple servers in the config instead of just one
  * And make the result async and send output to different files
* Better async support
* Proper escaping of args sending to remote
* Support custom functions in template stuff
* Expose template stuff for use by others
* Ship logs back from remote instead of just outputting them
